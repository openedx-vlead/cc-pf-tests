#+TITLE: Documentation of the project
* Introduction:-
 This document explains about how to analyze the performance of a college cloud
 using elk stack.
* Objective:-
 To analyze the performance of the college cloud.

* Requirements:-
 1)To analyse the performance of a college cloud we need an elk stack tool for
  visualizing the given logs of the college cloud.
* Design
 The design of the project is as follows.
 [[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/cc-pf-tests/blob/master/src/elkstack/design/index.org][Design]]
* Implementation:-

Virtual Labs College Cloud Edition is the Portable-Edition for Virtual Labs. It
 offers the offline version of Virtual labs, experiments and theoretical
 content. This edition addresses the lack of internet access or poor internet
 connectivity across different institutes/colleges.
 It results in a very cost-effective Learning Management System.
ELK stack:
 The ELK Stack is a collection of three open-source products  Elasticsearch,
 Logstash, and Kibana  from Elastic. Elasticsearch is a NoSQL database that is
 based on the Lucene search engine. Logstash is a log pipeline tool that
 accepts inputs from various sources, executes different transformations, and
 exports the data to various targets.
 Kibana is a visualization layer that works on top of Elasticsearch.
For instaling elkstack [[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/cc-pf-tests/blob/master/src/elkstack/scripts/elk_installer_container.org][link]]

1)We need to give log files to elasicsearch database which is connected to
kibana. In kibana we can visualize the graphs of logs of college cloud.

2)All logfiles are in text format but elasticsearch takes only json files as
input so we need to convert all text files to json format.

3) Conversion of logfiles to json format takes place in logstash as shown in design.
