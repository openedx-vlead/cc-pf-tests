#+TITLE: Working on kibana
In this document we will see how kibama works and what are the basics things
required in kibama for visualizing.
* Introduction
After successfully installing kibana.open "localhost:5601" in your webbrowser
and login with the credentials while installing kibana.

For staring kibana you need to create an index.You can see all the indices by
following.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Go to settings->indices
#+END_EXAMPLE
which lists all the indices created till now.

* Creating indices and inserting data to the indices
For creating an index named vlead run the following command in your terminal.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
curl -XPUT localhost:9200/vlead -d '{
    "index" : {
        "analysis" : {
            "analyzer" : {
                "default" : {
                    "type" : "keyword"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}'

#+END_EXAMPLE
 After succesfully running the above command go to kibama and enter the index
 name (vlead) to create vlead named index in kibana.

Now inserting data to the indices
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
CURL -PUT HTTP://LOCALHOST:9200/VLEAD/1 -D '
{
    "FIRST_NAME" : "KARTHIK",
    "LAST_NAME" :  "SMITH",
    "AGE" :        21,
    "HEIGHT": 5.11,
    "ABOUT" :      "I LOVE TO CODE",
    "INTERESTS": [ "SPORTS", "MUSIC" ]
}'
#+END_EXAMPLE
The above data will be inserted into the elasticsearch database which in turn
is connected to kibana.The entered data can be seen in kibana
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Go to discover and select the index you want to see its data.
Now you can see the complete data in the specific index.
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Inserting data through json format to kibana
 To insert the data from .json format.run the following command.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
curl -XPOST localhost:9200/vlead/my_doc_type/_bulk --data-binary  @kibana.json
#+END_EXAMPLE
The above command posts the data from kibana.json to an index named vlead.
* Visualizing the given data
Now you can also visualize the given using kibama. 
go to visualize and select the graph and then select the index you want to visualize. 
There you can set the parameters on both axes.
You can visualize using histogram,bargraph,piechart etc
* Note 
 Refresh the settings in setings/indices/
